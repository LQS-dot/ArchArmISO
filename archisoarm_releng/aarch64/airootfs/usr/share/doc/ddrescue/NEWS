Changes in version 1.27:

A deadlock in command mode when stdout is fully buffered has been fixed by
flushing stdout after executing each command. (Reported by Jeffrey Bosboom).

The new option '-W, --compare-before-write' has been added. It omits
superfluous writes in rescue mode.
(Suggested by Kajetan Harald Hinner and Petr Slansky).

Diagnostics caused by invalid arguments to command line options now show the
argument and the name of the option.

The option synonym '--direct' has been removed and is no longer recognized.

'long long' is now used instead of 'long' for time variables.

A missing '#include <cstdlib>' has been added.
