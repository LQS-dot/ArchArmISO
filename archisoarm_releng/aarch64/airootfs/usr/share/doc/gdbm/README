GNU dbm README
See the end of file for copying conditions.

* Introduction

This file contains brief information about configuring, testing
and using GNU dbm.  It is *not* intended as a replacement
for the documentation, instead it is provided as a brief reference
only. The complete documentation is available in doc/ subdirectory.
To read the manpage without installing the package use `man
doc/gdbm.3'.  To read texinfo documentation without installing the
package, run `info -f doc/gdbm.info'.  After the package is installed
the documentation can be accessed by running `man gdbm' and
`info gdbm'.

* Overview

GNU dbm is a set of database routines that use extendable hashing and
works similar to the standard UNIX dbm routines.  The library provides
also an optional compatibility layer for UNIX-like dbm and ndbm calls.

* Configuration

   a)  configure [PARAMETERS]
   b)  make 

For a list of generic PARAMETERS, see the file INCLUDE.  The gdbm-specific
parameters are:

** --enable-memory-mapped-io

Enable the use of mmap(2) for I/O optimizations.  This is the default,
if mmap is available.  To disable mmap, use --disable-memory-mapped-io.

** --enable-libgdbm-compat

Build and install libgdbm_compat, a compatibility layer which provides
UNIX-like dbm and ndbm interfaces.  It includes two header files:
dbm.h and ndbm.h, which are installed into $includedir.  If you wish
to install them elsewhere, define the variable COMPATINCLUDEDIR, e.g.

 ./configure --enable-libgdbm-compat COMPATINCLUDEDIR=/usr/include/gdbm

** --without-readline

Don't compile GNU Readline support.  By default, configure enables
line-editing support if GNU Readline is available on the system.

** --enable-gdbmtool-debug

This option instruments gdbmtool for additional debugging. Configured
with this option, gdbmtool accepts two additional arguments:
--lex-trace, which enables tracing the operation of the lexical
analyzer, and --gram-trace, which enables parser tracing output.

Note, that bison and flex must be installed for this option to take effect, 

* Installation 

  make install

This package also contains the 'magic' file for the file(1) utility -
src/gdbm.magic.  It is not installed by default, as its installation
location differs considerably between various distributions.  The most
straightforward (but not the best one) approach is appending its
content to /etc/magic:

  cat src/gdbm.magic >> /etc/magic

See the documentation in your distribution for detailed instructions
on how to install this file.
