Gdbm files have never been `portable' between different operating systems,
system architectures, or potentially even different compilers.  Differences
in byte order, the size of file offsets, and even structure packing make
gdbm files non-portable.

Therefore, if you intend to send your database to somebody over the wire,
please dump it into a portable format using gdbm_dump and send the resulting
file instead. The receiving party will be able to recreate the database from
the dump using the gdbm_load command.

Please refer to the documentation, chapters 25 and 26, for a detailed
discussion of these two tools. Run `info gdbm gdbm_dump', if gdbm is
already installed on your system, or `info -f doc/gdbm.info gdbm_dump'
to read the docs from the source tree.

The documentation is also available online at
http://www.gnu.org.ua/software/gdbm/manual.
