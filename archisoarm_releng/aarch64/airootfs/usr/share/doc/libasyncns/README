Overview

   libasyncns is a C library for Linux/Unix for executing name service
   queries asynchronously. It is an asynchronous wrapper around
   getaddrinfo(3), getnameinfo(3), res_query(3) and res_search(3) from
   libc and libresolv.

   In contrast to GNU's asynchronous name resolving API getaddrinfo_a(),
   libasyncns does not make use of UNIX signals for reporting completion
   of name queries. Instead, the API exports a standard UNIX file
   descriptor which may be integerated cleanly into custom main loops.

   In contrast to asynchronous DNS resolving libraries like [18]libdenise,
   [19]skadns, [20]adns, libasyncns is just an asynchronous wrapper around
   the libc's synchronous getaddrinfo() API, which has the advantage of
   allowing name resolution using techniques like [21]Multicast DNS, LDAP
   or NIS using standard libc NSS (Name Service Switch) modules.
   libasyncns is compatible with IPv6 if the underlying libc is.

   libasyncns is very tiny, consisting of just one header and one source
   file. It has no dependencies besides libc.

   By default libasyncns spawns a number of worker threads (LWPs) to
   process name queries. Alternatively or when POSIX Threads are not
   supported, libasyncns can fork() off worker processes instead.

Current Status

   Version 0.8 is quite stable and feature complete.

   Damien Thébault has written a Python module [22]libasyncns-python that
   wraps the libasyncns C API.

Documentation

   You may browse the [23]Doxygen generated [24]programing documentation
   the API. (Run make doxygen to generate this documentation from the
   source tree)

Requirements

   Currently, libasyncns is tested on Linux and Solaris
   (sparc-sun-solaris2.8) only.

   libasyncns was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux "testing" from
   January 2005, it should work on most other Linux distributions (and
   maybe Unix versions) since it uses GNU autoconf and GNU libtool for
   source code configuration and shared library management.

   libasyncns has no dependencies besides a libc that supports
   getaddrinfo() and res_query().

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of libasyncns.

Acknowledgements

   Sjoerd Simons for the res_query() support.
