<p>
        Post-probing filters are required to identify whether a plugin can handle a given
        modem, in special cases where the information retrieved from udev is either not
        enough or wrong. This covers, for example, RS232 modems connected through a RS232
        to USB converter, where udev-reported vendor ID is that of the converter, not the
        one of the modem.
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Allowed vendor strings</em></span></p>
<p>
            Plugins can provide a list of vendor strings to be used as post-probing
            filters. If the vendor string reported by the device via AT commands
            is found in the list provided by the plugin, the plugin will report that
            it can handle this modem.
          </p>
<p>
            This filter is specified by the <span class="type">MM_PLUGIN_ALLOWED_VENDOR_STRINGS</span>
            property in the <span class="structname">MMPlugin</span> object provided
            by the plugin.
          </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Product strings</em></span></p>
<p>
            Plugins can provide a list of pairs of vendor and product
            strings to be used as post-probing filters.
          </p>
<p>
            If the vendor and product string pair reported by the device via AT
            commands is found in the 'allowed' list provided by the plugin, the
            plugin will report that it can handle this modem. This additional filter
            should be used when the plugin is expected to work only with a given
            specific product of a given vendor.
          </p>
<p>
            If the vendor and product string pair reported by the device via AT
            commands is found in the 'forbidden list provided by the plugin, the
            plugin will report that it cannot handle this modem. This additional filter
            should be used when the plugin supports all devices of a given vendor, except for some specific ones.
          </p>
<p>
            These filters are specified by the <span class="type">MM_PLUGIN_ALLOWED_PRODUCT_STRINGS</span>
            and <span class="type">MM_PLUGIN_FORBIDDEN_PRODUCT_STRINGS</span> properties in the
            <span class="structname">MMPlugin</span> object provided by the plugin.
          </p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p><span class="emphasis"><em>Icera support</em></span></p>
<p>
            Plugins can specify that they only support Icera-based modems, or that they
            do not support any Icera-based modem. When either of this configurations is
            enabled, the Icera support checks will be included in the
            probing sequence, and the result of the check will help to determine whether
            the plugin supports the modem or not.
          </p>
<p>
            This filter is specified by the <span class="type">MM_PLUGIN_ALLOWED_ICERA</span> and
            <span class="type">MM_PLUGIN_FORBIDDEN_ICERA</span> properties in the
            <span class="structname">MMPlugin</span> object provided by the plugin.
          </p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="note"><p>
          Plugins which require post-probing filters will always be sorted last, and
          therefore they will be the last ones being checked for pre-probing filters. This
          is due to the fact that we need to assume that these plugins aren't able to
          determine port support just with pre-probing filters, as we want to avoid
          unnecessary probing sequences launched. Also note that the Generic plugin is
          anyway always the last one in the list.
