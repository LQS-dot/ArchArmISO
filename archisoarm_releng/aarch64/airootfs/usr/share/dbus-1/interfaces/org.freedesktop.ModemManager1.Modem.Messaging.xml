      org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Modem.Messaging:
      @short_description: The ModemManager Messaging interface.

      The Messaging interface handles sending SMS messages and notification of new
      incoming messages.

      This interface will only be available once the modem is ready to be
      registered in the cellular network. 3GPP devices will require a valid
      unlocked SIM card before any of the features in the interface can be
      used (including listing stored messages).

        This method should only be used once and subsequent information
        retrieved either by listening for the
        #org.freedesktop.ModemManager1.Modem.Messaging::Added signal,
        or by querying the specific SMS object of interest.
