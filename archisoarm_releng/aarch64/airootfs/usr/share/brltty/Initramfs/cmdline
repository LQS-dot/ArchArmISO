# This file is where you can specify any rd.brltty. kernel parameters that are
# to be included within the initramfs image and applied as default values.

# The order of precedence, from lowest to highest, for an option's value is:
# * BRLTTY built-in default
# * /etc/brltty.conf
# * initramfs override
# * this file
# * kernel command line

# Blank lines are ignored. A hash [#] anywhere on a line begins a comment which
# continues till the end of that line - only those characters before it are
# significant. Any number of space-separated options may be specified on a
# line. The syntax for an option is name=value (without the rd.brltty. prefix).
# The =value part is optional - if there's no = then the value is yes.
