# Description: To get the display manager of server

# The following is borrowed from Mandrake 9.2
# we have to assume that /$SYSCONF_PATH/desktop has two variables, DESKTOP
# and DISPLAYMANAGER because administors may prefer a specific DM regardless
# of desktops.
# DISPLAYMANAGER is referenced by this script, and DESKTOP is referenced
# as system-wide default by /etc/X11/Xsession script only when X-session
# is opened by "startx" command. 
# when DMs open an X-session, they send DESKTOP, which is in this case
# directly selected by users, as a commandline argument of /etc/X11/Xsession.
# actually Xsession script is only able to know by existance of its first
# argument whether it is called by DM or "startx". see the logic
# in /etc/X11/Xsession.
# If DISPLAYMANAGER is not defined, then assume that it is the same as DESKTOP
